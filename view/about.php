                <p class="lead">Jason is an adopted local artist, originating in Brighton but now calling Liverpool his home. His work reflects his playful yet elegant demeanour, using hand-placed crystals to bounce light and colour through a room.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">Whilst living by the coast, Jason spent countless hours watching sunlight glisten off the waves - this is where his passion for sparkle began.</p>
                <p class="lead">Inspired by nature, Jason uses light to bring his pieces to life. Using hundreds of hand-placed crystals, he creates an array of ever-changing colours and movements in his pieces.</p>
